==========================

I am learning Abacus from last 15 months. An Abacus is a calculation tool used to perform mathametical functions.
There are total 8 levels in Abacus and currently I am in 5th level.  
With Abaucs with can perform additions, subtractions, multiplications and divisions easily.
To do calculations we need to learn some formulas.
If we practise more we can perform calculations mentally by visualizing without using Abacus tool.
There are multiple topics in Abacus like mental dictation, speed writing and jumble dictation.
Learning Abacus also improves concentraion, enhanses visulization and imagination.
Learning Abacus is fun and exiting.
